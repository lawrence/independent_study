# Occurrence Map Page for User Calls into Shenzhen Towers

HTML page of occurrence timeline map.

Some issues/notes that I had personally.

- Finding the filter settings in Mapbox was a bit time consuming because I didn't read carefully through the doc enough. The filter layer is YOUR map_id name!
- IF you convert the file to GeoJSON, make sure that property types are what you want on the tileset's main page!
- occ as a property name does not get picked up for some whatever strange reason.
